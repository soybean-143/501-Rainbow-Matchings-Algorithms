# 501-Rainbow-Matchings-Algorithms
This code was created for the completion of a 501 project based on work done by JÃ¼rgen Kritschgau.
It has not been optimized for efficiency. Each cell runs a slightly different program utilizing the igraph family to visualize the algorithm as presented by Kritschgau.
Changing the graph the code runs on in the global cell changes the graph for all the cells. As it is set up now, the graph, coloring, and algorithm choices change with each run.
