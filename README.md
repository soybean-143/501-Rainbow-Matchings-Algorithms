# 501-Rainbow-Matchings-Algorithms
#This code created for completion of a 501 project based off of work done by JÃ¼rgen Kritschgau.
#This code has not been optomized for efficiency. Each cell runs a slightly different program utilizing the igraph family to visualize the algorithm as presented by Kritschgau.
#Changing the graph the code runs on in the global cell changes the graph for all the cells. As it is set up now, the graph, coloring, and algorithm changes with each run.
